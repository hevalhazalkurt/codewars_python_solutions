## No Loops 2 - You only need one


**No Loops Allowed**

You will be given an array `(a)` and a value `(x)`. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value, without using a loop.

Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either. Return true if the array contains the value, false if not. With strings you will need to account for case.
